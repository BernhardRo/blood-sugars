Indidividual CGM readings are less accurate than a manual blood
glucose test. Karen uses manual tests to adjust the CGM sensor to
account for the differences between blood glucose level and
the interstitial glucose levels measured by the CGM sensor. Although
individual readings are less accurate, average CGM readings may be
more accurate than averages based on manual tests, assuming Karen does
enough manual tests to keep the CGM sensor reasonably accurate.

When active, the CGM sensor records a new reading every five
minutes. Manual tests happen whenever Karen pricks her finger for a
direct blood glucose measurement. Interstitial fluid glucose levels
are a lagging indicator of blood glucose levels and the sensor is
sometimes inaccurate. Karenq only "corrects" her blood glucose level,
by consuming sugar or shooting corrective insulin, after confirming
the CGM reading with a manual blood glucose measurement. This biases
the manual blood glucose tests. Many of these tests, perhaps a
majority, occur when Karen believes she is either high or low. When
the CGM believes she is in the normal range, she performs fewer manual
tests. This bias is not extreme, but it is present.
