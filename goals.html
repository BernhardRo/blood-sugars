    Goals:
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h5>DONE:</h5> Setup and manage the Nightscout Mongo database and
        website.</li>
    <li>
        <p><em>IN PROGRESS:</em> Learn how to effecively query the Mongo database from R.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I can pull down all of data, but my ability to restrict my query to
                items of interest is still limited.</li>
            <li><em>DONE:</em> Experiment with RMongo.</li>
            <li><em>DONE:</em> Experiment with rmgondb.</li>
            <li><em>TODO:</em> Experiment with mongolite as a possible alternative to rmongodb.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><em>DONE:</em> Import Nightscout data from Mongo into R.</p></li>
    <li>
        <em>DONE:</em> Export Nightscout data as a CSV file.</li>
    <li>
        <em>DONE:</em> Use the Nightscout data to make some plots of
        blood glucose levels.</li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Create a template report (PDF?) for Karen that
        allows us to better understand her blood glucose patterns over
        any arbitrary time frame.</li>
    <li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Create an interactive dashboard (Shiny!) for
        Karen that allows us to better understand her blood glucose
        patterns over any arbitrary time frame.</li>
    <li>
        
        <em>TODO:</em> Finish reading <a href="http://sugarsurfing.com/">Sugar Surfing</a>.</li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Use ideas from the book to improve our reporting and
        processing of Karen's CGM data.</li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Develop a method to predict extreme highs and
        lows before they happen. CGMs measure interstitial glucose
        levels, which are lagging indicators of blood glucose
        levels. Because Karen often swings quickly, this can be a
        problem. I would like to find recurring patterns in her
        Nightscout data that can help us see a high/low coming before
        it happens.</li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Assuming I can do this, can I make the process
        of finding these patterns generic and available to others?</li>
    <li>
        <em>TODO:</em> Publish a R package to make it easier for others to repeat
        what I come up with.</li>
</ul>
