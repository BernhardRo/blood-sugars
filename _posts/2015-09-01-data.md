I received an interesting email from someone in France today about the
Blood Sugars project. I haven't posted any of this to any of the R
meme-blogo-spheres, so I wonder how she found my little project. It
doesn't really matter, but I do intend to ask. My new pen-pal is a
Type 1 diabetic who would like to follow along with the code examples
I have been posting but isn't sure how to start.

This is a great question! How to start? Apparently, I need to be a
little more transparent. I'm also going to throw out some links.

There are two really good R-documentation websites on the Internet
that I like to point people to.

* [http://www.cookbook-r.com/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)

If you are looking for help,
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is the BEST community for
getting help. The people there are scary smart. R-specific help can be
found at:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

If you are new to R, bookmark all three.

All of the code and data I am creating is hosted on my GitHub
account. The repository page can be found here:

[https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars).

The first post on this project blog was on July 29, 2015. In the post,
"Get CGM Data", I present a long winded explanation and some code to
import Nightscout data into R and save it as a CSV file. The R
Markdown file (and thus the code) used to create the blog post can be
found here:

[https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/blob/master/2015-07-29-get-cgm-data.Rmd](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/blob/master/2015-07-29-get-cgm-data.Rmd).

The data is stored in the data folder of the project. If you would
like to see the data files, they are available here:

[https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/tree/master/data](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/tree/master/data)

As of September 1, 2015, there are two CSV data sets in the data
folder. To make life easier for everyone, the following two links will
take you to the raw CSV files. You can simply save these files to your
computer to import the data into R, Excel or any other tool you would
like to use.

* [entries-2015-07-29.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Choens/blood-sugars/master/data/entries-2015-07-29.csv)
* [entries-2015-09-01.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Choens/blood-sugars/master/data/entries-2015-09-01.csv)

The file, entries-2015-07-29.csv was produced as a side-affect of
compiling the R Markdown code which produced the blog post for July
29. The second file is a larger data set which I produced today using
a small function and script I added to make it easier to produce new
data sets. The function can be found
[here](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/blob/master/R/importNightscout.R)
and the script can be found
[here](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/blob/master/get-nightscout-data-from-server.R). Using
the files is REALLY easy. Import them. The first row in both files
contains the column names. Each file-name contains a date stamp which
corresponds with when the files were created. Each file is a complete
extract of our Nightscout database as of the date shown. To use the
data files, you do not have to concatenate the two files. Just import
one or the other into your favorite analysis tool and have fun. The
second file is larger and has more data. The data is ONLY CGM data. It
doesn't include any exercise or calorie information. That is good
information to collect, but isn't part of the Nightscout project.

If you want to grab all of the code, data, etc. and don't want to wade
though all the links I just gave you, all you need to do is right
click on the link below and save the master.zip file to your local
computer. I promise, none of the code here will destroy your
computer. Of course, caveat emptor.

[https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/archive/master.zip)

The master.zip file contains the current "master" branch of the
project. Unzip the folder anywhere you want. The CGM data is in the
"data" folder. This data should be easy to import into Excel, SAS,
SPSS, Python, etc. R functions are in the "R" folder. R Markdown files
and scripts are in the root folder.

If you are a Git user, you can download the repository using Git by
cloning: https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars.git

If you want to use the R code, make sure you set your working
directory to the folder where the R Markdown files (.Rmd) are. This is
the working directory I use when writing the code. If you aren't sure
what that means, read
[this](http://rprogramming.net/set-working-directory-in-r/).

If you are new to R, I STRONGLY recommend you use
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop). It is
the best R programming environment for new programmers. It is easy to
set up, easy to use and is available for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Setting the R working directory is really easy in RStudio. Open any of
the .Rmd files in the folder where you unzipped the master.zip file. In the
menu, go to:

"Session" --> "Set Working Directory" --> "To Source File Location"

Congrats. You are done. Your working directory is now set
to the folder holding the Blood Sugar .Rmd files. All of the code
should now work.

If the code doesn't work and you think my code is broken; file a bug
against the project
[here](https://github.com/Choens/blood-sugars/issues). If my writing
is unclear, feel free to send me an email.
