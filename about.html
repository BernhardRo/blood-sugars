    About:
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the
        amount of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or
        animal. The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose
        levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis.

<h2>Motivation:</h2>

<p>
    My wife is the motivation behind this project. As a T1D, her body
    does not produce insulin. This means her body cannot properly
    process or control glucose (sugar) in her system. The following
    image is an "ideal" glucose-insulin curve pattern I found on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar#/media/File:Suckale08_fig3_glucose_insulin_day.png">Wikipedia</a>.

    Karen controls her blood glucose levels manually using an external supply of
    insulin which is injected into her body via a "pump" she wears at all
    times. Maintaining homeostasis requires external tools and conscious
    maintenance. The CGMs compliment other methods of measuring blood
    glucose levels, such as the classic finger-prick method. The finger
    prick method is actually more accurate than the CGM, but is more
    involved and is done infrequently thoughout the day.
</p>

<p>
    Continuous Glucose Monitors such as the Dexcom G4 are revolutionary
    because they measure interstitial glucose levels roughly every 5
    minutes. And they do so without the conscious aid or effort of the
    diabetic. Using alarms to notify the T1D of lows and highs can improve
    blood glucose control and simplify the life of the T1D. Correcting
    glucose imbalances is still a conscious process, but CGMs do simplify
    and automate part of the monitoring process.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the accuracy of today's CGMs is below that of a
    traditional blood glucose meter. The traditional blood glucose meter
    (finger prick) measures the level of glucose in the blood
    directly. CGMs do not. They measure the level of sugar in the
    diabetic's interstitial fluid. Interstitial glucose levels are a
    lagging indicator of blood glucose level. Thus, by the time the CGM
    detects a change in the interstitial glucose levels, the diabetic may
    already be quite high or quite low. This is especially true for
    brittle T1Ds, like Karen, who can fluctuate rapidly.
</p>

<p>
    With all that said, these things are awesome. The ability to get
    near-real-time feedback is a game changer for diabetes self
    management. Obviously, more accurate and sensitive sensors are
    desired, but the current generation sensors are quite good. The
    accuracy of a CGM is measured by something called a Mean Absolute
    Relative Difference (MARD) between what it reads from the interstitial
    fluid and what is measured by a lab blood glucose test. Dexcom claims
    the 2015 "G4 Platinum with share" has a 9% MARD, which
    <a href="http://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum-performance">they claim</a> is
    the first single digit MARD on the market. The previous generation
    of device has a 13% MARD.

<p>
    We (and many others fighting Diabetes every day) thank Dexcom for
    making terrific hardware and we thank the makers of the
    <a href="https://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/">XDrip</a> and
    <a href="http://www.nightscout.info/">Nightscout</a>
    projects for making great software. If you are a
    diabetic and you want to take charge of how you
    manage your health, this is the best way I know of
    to do it. You are the one in charge, as it should
    be.

    Data and Dexcom:
</h2>

<p>
    The source of the raw data is a
    <a href="http://www.dexcom.com/">Dexcom</a>
    <a href="http://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum-share">G4 Platinum System with
        Share</a> Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) worn by
    my wife, Karen, who has been a Type 1 Diabetic
    (T1D) since she was seven. We are using an Android
    app,
    <a href="https://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/">XDrip</a>
    to collect the data from the CGM and upload it to
    a Nighscout database. Her cloud-based CGM data
    drives a website which allows her to track her CGM
    data on her phone and
    <a href="http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/labs/pebble_watchface_custom_alerts">Pebble
        Watch</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You <i>can</i> do all of this with an Apple Phone and
    Apple watch ($$$) or you can DIY and build your own rig as we have. As
    of June 2015, the Dexcom website does not list Android as a supported
    platform for cloud-based CGM and there are no publicly announced plans
    to support the Android platform, let alone the Pebble Watch. The
    applications we are using are all open source and available to anyone
    who wants to learn more about diabetes self-management (diabetic
    required). Unlike the Apple-based system, the rig we are using is not
    FDA certified.
