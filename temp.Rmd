When worn regularly and correctly, CGM sensor data is not subject to
the measurement biases inherent in manual blood glucose tests which
could make CGM data a better source of this clinical
information. Karen is more likely to test when she believes she is
high or low, which can bias averages based on manual tests, even
though individually a manual test is more accurate than a CGM
reading. The next three sections look at Karen's CGM readings in these
three range groups more closely and include the average sensor values
in each range.
