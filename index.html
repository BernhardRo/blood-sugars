                    This is a place for me to learn how to work with diabetes
                    blood glucose data obtained from the <a href="http://www.nightscout.info/">Nightscout Project</a>.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount
                        of glucose (sugar) present in the blood of a human or animal. The
                        body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of
                        metabolic homeostasis.

                    my wife, Karen, who has been a Type 1 Diabetic
                    (T1D) since she was seven. We are using an Android
                    app,
                    <a href="https://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/">XDrip</a>
                    to collect the data from the CGM and upload it to
                    a Nighscout database. Her cloud-based CGM data
                    drives a website which allows her to track her CGM
                    data on her phone and

                    You <i>can</i> do all of this with an Apple Phone and
                    Apple watch ($$$) or you can DIY and build your own rig as we have. As
                    of June 2015, the Dexcom website does not list Android as a supported
                    platform for cloud-based CGM and there are no publicly announced plans
                    to support the Android platform, let along the Pebble Watch. The
                    applications we are using are all open source and available to anyone
                    who wants to learn more about diabetes self-management (diabetic
                    required). Unlike the Apple-based system, the rig we are using is not
                    FDA certified.

                <h3>Motivation:</h3>

                <p>
                    My wife, Karen, is the motivation behind this project. As a T1D, her
                    body does not produce insulin. This means her body cannot properly
                    process or control glucose (sugar) in her system. The following image
                    is an "ideal" glucose-insulin curve pattern I found on
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar#/media/File:Suckale08_fig3_glucose_insulin_day.png">Wikipedia</a>.
                </p>

                    She controls her blood glucose levels by using an external supply of
                    insulin which is injected into her body via a "pump" she wears at all
                    times. Maintaining homeostasis requires external tools and conscious
                    maintenance. The CGMs compliment other methods of measuing blood
                    glucose levels, such as the classic finger-prick method. The finger
                    prick method is actuall MORE accurate than the CGM, but is more
                    involved and is done infrequently thoughout the day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Continuous Glucose Monitors such as the Dexcom G4 are revolutionary
                    because they measure interstitial glucose levels roughly every 5
                    minutes. And they do so without the conscious aid or effort of the
                    diabetic. Using alarms to notify the T1D of lows and highs can improve
                    blood glucose control AND simplify the life of the T1D. Correcting
                    glucose imbalances is still a conscious process, but CGMs do simplify
                    and automate part of the monitoring process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the accuracy of today's CGMs is below that of a
                    traditional blood glucose meter. The traditional blood glucose meter
                    (finger prick) measures the level of glucose in the blood
                    directly. CGMs do not. They measure the level of sugar in the
                    diabetic's interstitial fluid. Interstitial glucose levels are a
                    lagging indicator of blood glucose level. Thus, by the time the CGM
                    detects a change in the interstitial glucose levels, the diabetic may
                    already be quite high or quite low. This is especially true for
                    brittle T1Ds like Karen who can fluctuate rapidly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With all that said, these things are _awesome_. The ability to get
                    near-real-time feedback is a game changer for diabetes self
                    management. Obviously, more accurate and sensitive sensors are
                    desired, but the current generation sensors are quite good. The
                    accuracy of a CGM is measured by something called a Mean Absolute
                    Relative Difference (MARD) between what it reads from the interstitial
                    fluid and what is measured by a lab blood glucose test. Dexcom claims
                    the 2015 "G4 Platinum with share" has a 9% MARD, which
                    <a href="http://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum-performance">they claim</a> is
                    the first single digit MARD on the market. The previous generation
                    of device has a 13% MARD.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We (and many others fighting Diabetes every day) thank Dexcom for
                    making terrific hardware and we thank the makers of the
                    <a href="https://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/">XDrip</a> and

                    projects for making great software. If you are a
                    diabetic and you want to take charge of how you
                    manage your health, this is the best way I know of
                    to do it. You are the one in charge, as it should
                    be.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Karen's CGM takes a reading 12 times an hour, 24 hours a day. Ideally,
                    her system should produce nearly 300 readings a day and a little over
                    2,000 readings a week. That is a lot of data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Conveniently, I am a professional data analyst working for the New
                    York State Department of Health. I am not a doctor or medical
                    professional. But I do evaluate health care programs. My day job is to
                    work with "big data" generated by the Medicaid program in New York
                    State. This data is generated by millions of people across the
                    State. My goal is to use the same skills I use in my day job to
                    develop new ways of looking at and evaluating Karen's CGM data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is the moment where I feel obligated to say
                    the following: The work here has not been reviewed
                    by the FDA. Use at your own risk. I could be
                    wrong. If you find a bug, please tell me about
                    it. I welcome your input, but I'm not responsible
                    for your health or diabetes management. Hopefully
                    this clear indication that this is a part-time
                    project I'm doing to learn will keep the
                    lawyer-sharks at bay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For exploration and rapid prototyping, I will use R. Any useful ideas
                    will be discussed with the Nightscout developers. To measure my own
                    progress, a list of more discreet goals.

                        predict extreme highs and lows. This is important. CGMs measure
                        interstitial glucose levels, which are lagging indicators of blood
                        glucose levels. Because Karen often swings quickly, this can be a
                        problem. Can I find patterns in the data that can help us see a
                        change coming before it happens?</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>TODO:</em> If yes, how can I make the process of finding these patterns
                        available to others? In other words, how can I make a generalized
                        process (report, function, code, etc.) that can be used by anyone,
                        to find and predict rapid fluctuations in blood glucose level BEFORE
                        they happen.</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>TODO:</em> Publish a R package to make it easier for others to repeat
                        what I come up with.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Obviously, I am assuming there is some way to do this. But I could be
                    wrong. If I am, I'll still learn something. At the very least, I will
                    produce some reporting tools that may be of use to others.</p>
